Gini
The gini impurity is calculated using the following formula:

GiniIndex=1–∑jp2j

Where pj
 is the probability of class j.

The gini impurity measures the frequency at which any element of the dataset will be mislabelled when it is randomly labeled.

The minimum value of the Gini Index is 0. This happens when the node is pure, this means that all the contained elements in the node are of one unique class. Therefore, this node will not be split again. Thus, the optimum split is chosen by the features with less Gini Index. Moreover, it gets the maximum value when the probability of the two classes are the same.

Ginimin=1–(12)=0

Ginimax=1–(0.52+0.52)=0.5

Entropy
The entropy is calculated using the following formula:

Entropy=–∑jpj⋅log2⋅pj

Where, as before, pj
 is the probability of class j.

Entropy is a measure of information that indicates the disorder of the features with the target. Similar to the Gini Index, the optimum split is chosen by the feature with less entropy. It gets its maximum value when the probability of the two classes is the same and a node is pure when the entropy has its minimum value, which is 0:

Entropymin=−1⋅log2(1)=0

Entropymax=–0.5⋅log2(0.5)–0.5⋅log2(0.5)=1
